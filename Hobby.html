            <h3>Video Editing</h3>
            <p>
              In my free time I do video editing with footage that friends of
              mine or myself have collected. With the help of Adobe Premiere Pro
              and sometimes a bit of Adobe photoshop, I am able to create and
              add effects that can make videos more engaging to watch for
              others. It is a process that allows me to experiment and play
              around with different ideas which as a result make them more
              entertaining.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first got into video editing back in 2015, and since then, I
              have gradually been picking up more tricks and techniques as I go.
              While I don't take it too seriously, I still enjoy the process.
              It's fun to see what others in the editing world are doing and
              then try out some of those methods myself, Just to see how far I
              can push my own skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though it's more of a casual hobby, it's definitely something
              I like to do when I've got some spare time on my hands.

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>
              I don't just solely code for colllege assignments, but I also do
              some programming in my spare time too. I usually tend to try out
              different coding languages and see what I can make with them or
              make something that might be useful for later; (but in all
              honesty, a lot of the time I'm just experimenting and having some
              fun).
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, I have dabbled in a variety of languages like: 
              <ul>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Lua</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>css</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              Each language has its own quirks and possibilites, which is keeps
              me intrigued by how differently some work compared to others.
              It is interesting to see how different languages work and what impact you
              can make with them by applying them to real-world problems or creative projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              As of now I have been coding for 5 years (and counting), I'm always
              down to learn something new when I feel like diving into a new
              project; as I see it as an opportunity to puck up some fresh
              techniques or explore new features that I haven't touched before.
              Programming is something that keeps changing for me, which is what
              has kept me hooked for the past years.

          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p>
            Like a lot of IT students, I have a big interest in video games. For
            me, gaming is not only does it help as a form of relaxing but it
            also fuels my creativity; which helps me get inspiration for videos
            that I can edit or developing a new programming project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't think of gaming solely as a hobby; but also as a tool that
            helps drive my passion for creating and problem-solving. I tend to
            see the experiences and challenges I see in games and translate some
            of those to ideas I use for projects of mine, whether it's coding or
            video editing. So, for me, it's not just only about playing for fun
            or for glory, but also about using those experiences to push my
            creative boundaries even further beyond.
