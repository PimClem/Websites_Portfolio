          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a 20 year old IT student, I am currently following Application
            development. I live in Turnhout, Belgium and try my best to help
            everyone I can. In the future I would like to get a career focused
            on programming in app development. One of the main reasons I want to study
            app development is for the ability of letting loose your
            creativity and being able to make anything you want. It has always
            been a dream for me to entertain people and make them happy. Some
            soft skills I have include: Communication, adaptability and
            Problem-solving.
          </p>
