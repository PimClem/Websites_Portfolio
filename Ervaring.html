            <h3>Project PHP</h3>
            <h4>Task</h4>
            <p>
              As a group, we had to make a web application with PHP and Laravel
              for our client. Our client wanted a web application that could
              manage everything for their Restaurant and Cookie shop
              simultaneously.
            </p>
            <h4>Content</h4>
            <p>
              I was the Document Lead and decided to keep an eye on deadlines so
              everyone is up to date and know what to prioritise, I did not only
              keep myself busy with making sure the documents were done by the
              deadlines but did some heavy lifting of my own. I started with a
              page where you could add changes to the database and afterwards
              made the same thing for other tables.
            </p>
            <h4>Result</h4>
            <p>
              After a couple of months, we were able to create a nice result to
              which the client was satisfied with.
            </p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
              Communcation is key to projects. After a lot of trial and error we
              eventually made it happen due to everyone putting effort in it and
              helping eachother when needed.

            <h4>Task</h4>
            <p>
              For this project we had to make anything in C# aslong as it
              contained some kind of database.
            </p>

              I decided I would pick a library management as it seemed like a
              very simple program to make and understand. For the project I made
              forms like logging in and editing books and users. A database was
              made with SQLite, which I tried to learn as quick as possible.
            </p>
            <h4>Result</h4>
            <p>
              Personally for the amount the time I was given I have gotten
              pretty far in developing the system. Funny enough, I was pretty
              close to finishing it fully, if I was given a little bit more
              time.
            </p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
              Next time when I am considering to do a similar project like this,
              I'll try to see if I can learn anything before hand so I can work
              more efficiently.

          <h3>Internship</h3>
          <h4>Task</h4>
          <p>
            A friend and I have done an internship for the city Hall of
            Turnhout, where we have to help a client with their problem.
          </p>
          <h4>Content</h4>
          <p>
            Our client owns a Toy rental and wanted to have a system where it
            could keep track of toys via a database, my friend and I have been
            brainstorming and got the idea for using a barcode scanner that is
            put on the toys. We then had a meeting with the client talking about
            it and was interested in the idea. In the end we also had to make a
            tutorial video on how to use the barcode scanner effectively.
          </p>
          <h4>Result</h4>
          <p>
            In the end, the client and our supervisor were pretty happy with the
            results we presented.
          </p>
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            After that I have noticed being able to have more contact with your
            client via meetings is very helpful, as it helps everyone stay on
            the same page.
